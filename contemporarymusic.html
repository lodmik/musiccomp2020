                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Since so much of today's music production is dependent on electronic systems, I began wondering how the technology behind electronic music was born and how it developed into the state it is at now. With this contemporary music project, we dive into how the first synthesizer was born to how synthesizers were popularized.</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The Telharmonium, also known as the Dynamophone, was the first electronic/electromechanical musical instrument ever made.&nbsp;First introduced by Thaddeus Cahill in 1906, it was an incredibly primitive instrument and consumed a lot of power. It used an early form of loudspeakers, and since vacuum tubes were not invented at this time, it did not have amplifiers to boost its sound.<br><br>The Telharmonium was a polyphonic instrument and used multiple keyboards to as input. To create its sounds, the instrument used additive synthesis with electromagnetic tone wheels. Additive synthesis emulates sounds by adding overtones with sine waves.<br>The tone wheels produced these pure sine waves, making it able to replicate a majority of sounds and timbres. The instrument's ability to emulate woodwind instruments such as the flute, bassoon, clarinet, and also the cello was well-received.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The Hammond Organ was first built in 1925 and patented in 1934 by Laurens Hammond. It was based off the Telharmonium, and thus uses additive synthesis like its predecessor. Early versions of the organ used tonewheels like the Telharmonium, but later switched to integrated circuits to produce its sounds. For input, the organ had two keyboards called manuals that spanned five octaves each.<br><br>The organ also had a variety of features, such as a pedalboard for playing notes in a lower range, and vibrato and chorus to enrich the sounds. The organ also had customization in a form of sliding drawbars, which controlled the loudness of the organ’s sound components. They are similar to the faders on mixing boards found today.&nbsp;Furthermore, the organ had presets, which stored the settings of the drawbars, much like the presets of virtual instruments today.<br><br><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/LezlieCabinetSequence.ogg" class="text-white">Click here&nbsp;for a sound sample from WikiMedia</a></p>

It was later patented by Leon Theremin<br>in 1928.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To create its sound, the theremin uses a sine wave generator. It has two metal antennas—one on the side and one on the top—that detect the position of the thereminist’s hands. The distance from one hand (typically left) controls the amplitude of the sound while the distance from other hand (typically right) controls the pitch. Skilled thereminists are able to play flutters, scales, and effects on the theremin with ease.<br><br> Due to the way the&nbsp;Theremin sounds, it is popular in eerie or creepy movies.<br><br><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Epro_theremin_middle_bach.ogg" class="text-white">Click here for a sound sample from WikiMedia</a></p>

However, electronic artists struggled to create complex compositions since they had to cut up and put together thousands of pieces of tape.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The RCA Mark II was the first programmable digital synthesizer. It was designed by Herbert Belar and Harry Olson at RCA and took up a whole room, consisting of various sound synthesis components and a sequencer to automatically play notes. The sequencer used a paper tape system with hole punches to play notes and control parameters, similar to the self-playing pianos that use the same system.<br><br>The RCA's programability enabled musicians to play and compose music that could not be played on acoustic instruments, opening up possibilities for new rhythms and sounds. However, the device was very difficult to set up, as getting any sound out of the synth required complex patching of cables. Therefore, even though the synth received a lot of attention, it was not used very much due to the hassle of use.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Robert Moog started out by building theremins in his teenage years and helped engineer the RCA Mark II.<br>Before the Moog synth, creating music (especially mainstream music) with synthesizers were fairly impractical. With the invention of the Moog synth, he helped synthesizers become popular and mainstream. He is sometimes called the “inventor” of the synthesizer due to the impact his synthesizers made on music.<br><br>Robert Moog founded Moog Music (R. A. Moog Co. at the time) and invented the first commercialized synthesizer in search of creating a more affordable and usable synthesizer. The Moog synthesizer used a modular method of synthesis where every part of the synthesis process was a separate module. The oscillators, filters, amplifiers, and envelope generators, on the synth could be combined in a number of ways to create complex and detailed sounds. The Moog synth also had a familiar piano/keyboard interface, which made it easy for musicians to use.<br><br>Realizing that the Moog synth was too large for general use, Robert Moog created a smaller version, called the MiniMoog. The synth only featured the necessary components for modular synthesis and removed the need for patch cables entirely. Not only was the MiniMoog smaller, it had new features as well. The synth had options for vibrato and pitch bending with the pitch wheel.<br></p>
